## Description

This data directory contains the description of different solar flux tables that can be accessed using the `TRestAxionSolarFlux` object. To learn on how to use `TRestAxionSolarFlux` visit the [REST-for-Physics API](https://sultan.unizar.es/rest/).

Each solar table (due to different production mechanisms or particle) provides the pre-integrated(+) solar disc flux as a function of the solar radius and energy.

The **QCD** directory contains the solar QCD axion flux, and the **hiddenPhoton** directory contains the solar hidden photon flux.

(+) The effective solar flux is integrated to the corresponding solar disk (ring) area.
