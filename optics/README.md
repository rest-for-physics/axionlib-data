The following directory contains data files with X-ray reflectivity pre-downloaded data from the [https://henke.lbl.gov/](https://henke.lbl.gov/) database. These files will be generated by the [TRestAxionOpticsMirror](https://sultan.unizar.es/rest/classTRestAxionOpticsMirror.html) metadata class. The files will be used by that class to quickly load reflectivity data in memory, in case the requested optics properties are already available a this database.

See [TRestAxionOpticsMirror](https://sultan.unizar.es/rest/classTRestAxionOpticsMirror.html) documentation for further details on how to generate or load these datasets.
